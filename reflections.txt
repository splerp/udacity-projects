How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If problems are discovered in a particular part of the project, looking at previous commits in that area may make it easier to find the origin of the problem more quickly.

Reverting unneeded changes will be much easier; If a lot of code is lost or accidentally commited, each previous commit also works as a backup.
