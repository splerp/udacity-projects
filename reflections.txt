How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Looking through any large file for a single newly-introced bug can take a long time; the diff between two versions shows only the relevant changes and makes looking for problems much easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If problems are discovered in a particular part of the project, looking at previous commits in that area may make it easier to find the origin of the problem more quickly.

Reverting unneeded changes will be much easier; If a lot of code is lost or accidentally commited, each previous commit also works as a backup.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Knowing that a previous version can always be reverted to at any time makes changing the existing code a lot less risky.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Using git simply for the ability to revert to previous versions, for small personal projects.
